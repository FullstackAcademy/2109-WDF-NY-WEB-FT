# Bubble Sort

A test-driven approach to bubble sort.

To get started:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm test` to run the tests and watch for changes

You will be starting with a clean slate, which includes writing your _own_ test specs for your implementation of bubble sort. You can refer back to previous workshops or solutions for examples or inspiration for your tests!
