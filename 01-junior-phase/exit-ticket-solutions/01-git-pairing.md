# Day 01: Git, Pairing

**You should be able to:**
- Manage a project using git
- Practice effective pair programming


## Which `git` command adds files to the staging area?

|   | Option | Explanation |
| - | ------ | ----------- |
|   | `status` | Displays the current state of the working directory and staging area. |
| ☑️ | **`add`** | Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. |
|   | `commit` | Records and documents the changes to the repository. |
|   | `push` | Uploads local repository content to a remote repository. |


## For each concept, select which categories it fits into – git or GitHub:

|   | Git | GitHub | Explanation |
| - | --- | ------ | ----------- |
| clone | ☑️ |   | `clone` is a command in Git that lets us copy the contents of a remote repository (on GitHub) to our local machine; GitHub will give us a link to help us clone it, but it's not something we _do_ on GitHub. |
| repository  | ☑️ | ☑️ | GitHub lets us have a remote repository; we can initialize a new local repository using Git: `git init`. |
| fork |   | ☑️ | Forking makes a copy of a repository to our own GitHub profile so that we can make changes to it without affecting the original project. |
| commit | ☑️ | ☑️ | `commit` is a command in Git that saves a snapshot of our repository. You could mark Github on this one too since repositories are stored on Github therefore commits are also stored there. |

## For each choice pick whether it describes the driver or the navigator in pair programming:

|   | Driver | Navigator |
| - | ------ | --------- |
| Spots syntax issues |   | ☑️ |
| Reads the docs |   | ☑️ |
| Writes code | ☑️ |   |
| Sees the big picture |   | ☑️ |
| Works out the details | ☑️ |   |
| Speaks at a high level |   | ☑️ |
| Asks clarifying questions | ☑️ |   |
