# Lab: Webpack

The goal of this lab is to make this project work using Webpack. You'll have to do a few things to get there such as:
- Install Webpack and any other necessary libraries
- Add a build script to `package.json`
- Add a webpack config file
- Update the `index.html` to point to the right JS file
- Update the code in the `client` folder to use ES6 import / export statements
