### 👍 **Allowed Resources:**

- Student Notes (these may be hand-written _or_ typed)
- Documentation (see last section below)
- Lecture slides (try to download these ahead of time!)
- Help tickets (especially in case of specs not running or very basic clarification needed)
- Other curriculum resources (e.g. workshop code, demo code, etc.)
- Search Engines (see below for exceptions)

 ### 🚫 **Forbidden:**

- Other students' work (including current students and alums)
- Soliciting or accepting help from other students (e.g. via Slack, WhatsApp, Google Chat, text, etc.) during the allotted project time
- Using search engines to seek out solutions to the assigned project

### 📌 **Lastly:**

The purpose of this project is for you to write code that demonstrates what you've learned so far, and for us to be able to to work with you if there are gaps in your knowledge. Cheating, simply to pass, robs all of us of the ability to work together on your journey, and jeopardizes your spot in the program.
