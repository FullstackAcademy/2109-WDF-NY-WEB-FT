# Node Shell

## Target Result

The goal of this exercise is to built your **own** command line prompt! It will accept a few familiar commands, like `ls`, `cat` and `curl`. If you have time, you may even decide to build out even more commands and features!

## Learning Goals

* Familiarity with Node programs and their execution
* Basic understanding of the built-in `fs` and `http` modules
* Familiarity with the callback pattern for handling asynchronicity
