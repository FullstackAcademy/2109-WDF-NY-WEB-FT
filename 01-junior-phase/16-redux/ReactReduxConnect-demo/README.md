# Lab: Connect

## Getting Started

1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`

## Refactor!

Refactor this codebase to use `react-redux`. 

As a high-level overview we need to:
- `npm install react-redux`
- Set-up your `Provider` component
- Define your `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions
- Make `Counter` a functional component
- Call `connect`
