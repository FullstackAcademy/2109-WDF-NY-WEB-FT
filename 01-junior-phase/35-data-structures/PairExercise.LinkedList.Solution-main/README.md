# Linked Lists

Abstract Data Types (ADTs) are purely conceptual entities comprising information and allowed operations on that information. Data Structures (DSs) are actual programmatic solutions to implement an ADT. Both are very important to computer science in general and also a great way to better understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

In this workshop, we are going to be writing the JavaScript implementations of some different ADTs and DSs. In the first part of this workshop, we will focus on Queues and Linked Lists. In the second part of this workshop, we will shift our attention towards Binary Search Trees and Hash Tables.

## Getting Started

Don't forget to install the dependencies: `npm install`, and then run the tests with `npm test`.
This is a test-driven workshop, so you'll be writing code to make the provided tests pass.

### The Linked List DS

The LL operations are far easier to understand and account for if you diagram out the possible cases step-by-step with pencil and paper. You can also use an online diagramming tool (e.g. [Google Drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/0/create), [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), [Ziteboard](https://ziteboard.com/))

Compare the LL to the classic contiguous fixed Array (which does not exist in ES5 JavaScript). What are the pros and cons of each, and why?
