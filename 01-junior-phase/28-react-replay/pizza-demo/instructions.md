2. make Topping component and add placehodler to li
3. import topping in toppinglist
4. Add toppings to render in toppinglsit
5. Add props.toppingName to Topping
6. we need some way to update the selected topping - let's write a function that can update the state of toppinglist
7. Bind the method in constructor
8. We don't want the whole component to be clickable - so let's add onclick to specifically the list item within Topping.
9. In order for our Topping component to run the function we defined in ToppingList, let's pass it as a prop.
10. Add loop to ToppingList render
