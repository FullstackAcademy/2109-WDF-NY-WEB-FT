# Job Application Platform

## Overview
Implement a job application platform as a PWA (progressive web app) that allows employers to post jobs and find candidates as well as allows candidates to fill out their own profile and apply to jobs. The matching process can look like a Tinder like/pass page, a ranked listing of candidates/job postings, or something more complex.

## MVP
The PWA should support both views: candidate and employer. Candidates should be able to fill out a profile, browse for jobs, and apply. Employers should be able to post job listings, browse for candidates, and connect with people who would be a good match. The browsing feature for jobs and candidates should be filtered to the users' needs.

## Stretch Goals
* Incorporate extra features into a candidate's profile or a job's listing such as cover letters, videos, or quizzes (eg coding challenges)
* Real-time messaging between employers and candidates
* More selective list of suggested candidates/jobs which will attempt to optimize the suggestions based on compatibility

## Technical Challenges
* Mobile development
* Supporting multiple types of users and pages unique to those types (employer vs. candidate)
* Filtering the suggested list of candidates/jobs per user
