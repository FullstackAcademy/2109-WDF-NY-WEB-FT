Managing a budget can be difficult. Solve this problem by creating a financial planning app.

* Users can link a bank account and pull in overall balance information and individual transactions
* Users can set a monthly budget by spending category and track against the budget
* Users can see their spending by category
* Savings calculator to help users plan goals related to savings
* Data visualization for key charts / graphs

#### Stretch Goals

* Differentiating between bank transactions (debit card) vs. credit card transactions
* Email or text alerts when bills are due
* 401K calculator
* Subscription management (i.e. a clear way to see which subscriptions, such as Spotify, Apple Music, etc, that a user is signed up for and aiming to help cancel unused subscriptions)
* Mobile application

#### Technical Challenges

* Third party integration
* Intuitive UI / UX
