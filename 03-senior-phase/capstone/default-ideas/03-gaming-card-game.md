## Card Game Generator

#### Overview

Everyone loves card games! Build a website which allows users to create and play their own card games.

#### MVP

* Users can create and save their own card games by customizing their game's set of logic.
* Users can play their own card games.

#### Stretch Goals 

* Multiplayer game play can happen in real-time.

#### Technical Challenges

* Abstracting the logic for "what composes a card game" presents a unique object-oriented design challenge.
* Deciding what a card game looks like from a database perspective. How do you store the created games?

#### Suggested Stack

* Depending on how the logic is set-up, a non-relational database such as Firebase or MongoDB could better represent your data.
* React.
* For the real-time stretch goal: Socket.io or Firebase.
