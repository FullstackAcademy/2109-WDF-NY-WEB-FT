# Beta Testing

Beta Testing is a time for us to get together and have real users run through our current application and see what the user experience is like. It‚Äôs a good time for you and your team to see what a user (who has never used your application before) will experience when they load up your application and use it from the start to finish.

## Overall Plan

- At 4:00 PM we will all gather in the main zoom room. We will take a second to go over beta testing again and then we'll get started.
- This event will be held science-fair style in two 30-minute sessions.
- 1 - 2 people per team should be at their "stand" (breakout room) for 15 minutes at a time and swap with their teammates afterward (15 on, 15 off).
- Everyone else not presenting will be "walking around" and checking out other projects.

## Logistics

- Half the class will demo first (30 minutes).
- There will be 3 breakout rooms, and 1 - 2 reps from a team for each room. Reps swap with their teammates after 15 minutes, so that everyone gets a chance to check out other teams' projects, and don't have to be at their stand for 30 straight minutes.
- The second half of the class will present (30 minutes).
- After 30 minutes, we will reconvene in the main room, and I will create 2 new rooms for the second half of the class. The same thing will happen: 1 - 2 reps every 15 minutes.
- This means that at any moment in time, one room should have 1 - 2 reps for 1 team, and a group of other individuals checking out the project.

## Team Names

If you will notice above, there are team ids and team names listed (*in italics*). I copied and pasted it directly from the milestones responses. Please resubmit the form with a team name by Wednesday and I will change the name above as well. üëçüèΩ

## Code Freeze

There is also a spot on the calendar for code freeze. A code freeze is the stopping point where no more feature coding should be done. This is usually done to avoid people introducing more bugs into the code right before having to demo it to a client or in this case... beta testers. Use this time to fix any bugs you may have but all feature coding should cease at this point.

## Feedback Option

We have generated a [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ciW2T8VjBTUt7Qw0x_H9E37T7rMRnbr3B_8lnnfOFbk/edit) template for your team to gather feedback while you share your application. If you intend on using this form, make a copy of the form and customize it to match your own needs!

**DO NOT SEND A LINK TO THE ABOVE TEMPLATE, SEND A LINK TO YOUR COPIED / CUSTOM VERSION**

## How do I share my application?

- If you have a web application, please have it hosted, or take a look at [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for secure tunneling.
- If you have a mobile application hosted via Expo, you will ask the team that is testing to download the Expo Client app on their phones and then share the QR code. Ensure that your backend is hosted or that your server URL in redux is referencing your IP address.
- If you have a mobile application via Xcode, you can connect to Zoom via your phone and share the screen.

## Courtesy Asks

- Try to stay in a single room for at least 5 minutes so that the presenting dev teams do not need to repeat themselves.
- Give love to all projects; if you notice a room that is not as full as others, please pop in and show some support!
- Don't stay in the same room for the entire session.
- It's going to be a flashy Wednesday afternoon! Bring your enthusiasm , your relevant drink of choice, and of course, your application
