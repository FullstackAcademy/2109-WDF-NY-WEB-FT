# Stackathon Presentation Guide

## Format

**Viewing Party!**

* You will pre-record a video demo presenting your Stackathon and upload it to YouTube (much like with AWP) by Monday 01/10 10:00AM EST.
* You will be split into groups of 5-6 students and staff member, where each of you will present your pre-recorded video in a pre-assigned Zoom breakout room.
* Check which breakout room you will be presenting in [here](./slots.md)
* Discussion between presentations is encouraged. :)

## Length

Anywhere from 3-5 minutes!

_**Note**: Please do not record more than 5 minutes of footage due to the amount of presentations we will all be watching on that same day._

## Preparation

- If necessary have notes available to guide your recording to improve smoothness
- If public speaking is difficult for you, try practicing beforehand before recording
- Make sure your microphone is audible and clear when speaking
- Do some test recordings to verify your settings are adequate

## Potential Topics to Cover

### Your Vision

Introduce what the project is, the story behind it and what interested in you the project.

### User Story

If you have something to present, walk everyone through a user story of your app. Or if you don't have a user story, you can walk through the working parts of your app. Or if you really don't have much to show, a slide deck of a few slides of what you were trying to would suffice.

### The Technologies

Give us a rundown on what technologies you used and what are the technologies that you learned on your own outside the curriculum.

### The Challenges

- What did you learn?
- What major challenges did you face?

### Advice and Postmortem

- What advice would you give future developers pursuing this project?
- What would you have done differently?
- Would you use the same stack or use something different?

### Future Features

- Where does your vision take you?
- If you are working on it after graduation, what part of it will you immediately start working on again?
