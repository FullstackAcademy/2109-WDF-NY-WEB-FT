## FAQ

### Do I show the code?

You can show some code when presenting but only if what you are talking about requires code to be seen to be understood. Focus most of your time on talking through what the app does from the perspective of a type of user (guest, logged in, admin).

### Should everyone speak?

Yes

### Does teammate order matter?

No
